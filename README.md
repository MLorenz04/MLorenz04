# My project and repositories
Here you can find the works/projects on which I am **currently** working. Some of them are old and some of them are not updated or not finished... We all know that xD


## Connections
Connections is a logic game in which you are asked to find four groups, each having four words with something in common.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is nearly finished and I hope that one day i will add more features :)

## AeMMO
AeMMO is a series of Minecraft plugins to enhance the vanilla experience. Some of those plugins are AeArcheology or AeFishing. In the future, I would like to enhance mining and lumberjacking :)

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still in development


## WarriorCats
 Website for my card game, WaCards, created from my favorite book series Warrior Cats (Who would think that, hah)
 
> [!NOTE]
> This project is still in development!

 
## Aeternias
Web application for generating fantasy battles between chosen armies of warriors. You can create worlds, invite your friends in them, create units and generate battles!

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is not finished and will not be updated. I wrote this project as a final project for school in PHP and trust me, I do not want to write in PHP anymore 😸

## Sleduj hvězdy
Web blog created for tips and pieces of information about stars, planets, cool facts and information about space and, mainly, to try ThreeJS 3D models with custom moving galaxy in the background ;)

> [!WARNING]
> I am unsure, if I will ever lay hands on it again...
